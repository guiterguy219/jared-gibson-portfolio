## Beyond Coding

While I am passionate about building and the technology I work with, I believe it is essential to find balance in my life between work, family responsibilities, health, and meaningful recreation.

### Faith First

I believe that putting trust in God above my own strengths leads me to far better outcomes than what I could arrive at on my own, and yes – it is the foundation of finding _balance_. That's not to say I don't take responsibility for my work. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Prioritizing my faith means I value honesty and integrity above personal gain and convenience, allowing me to bring my best self to the table.

### Taking It Outside

I love to spend time outside, especially with my family. It's invigorating, beautiful, and awe-inspiring. There may be some irony in the fact that while my professional life is immersed in technology, my best time spent outside of work is completely disconnected. We love to explore anything from local canyons and trails to national parks and far-away sites.

### Mindful Hobbies

I've always been a fan of hobbies that contribute to my overall well-being.

I love to play music, and I consider myself a "campfire guitarist". I also dabble in piano, ukulele, and mandolin. For me, the purpose of playing music is to relax and unwind, and to connect with and bring joy to others.

On the more physical side of things, I love to run, hike and rock climb. I've never been competitive beyond a 5K/10K race here and there, but I love the challenge of pushing myself and, of course, the benefits that come with exercise. Rock climbing especially pushes my mental limits almost as much as it does my physical limits because of its problem-solving nature and the need to push out fear and anxiety.

I also spend a lot of time on house projects, including electrical, plumbing, drywall... pretty much anything that needs to be done in our old home. Though it's hardly a hobby, it's a good break from the desk and improves the beauty and functionality of our home.
