- **Build duration:** <1 hour (fun experiment)
- **Owner:** Myself

This project was built as a fun side project to help me and my family plan our Secret Santa gift exchange. It's a simple web application that allows you to create a Secret Santa gift exchange with unique reveal links for each participant without revealing the assignments to the coordinator. No signup required - everything runs in your browser!

The project was built entirely by Claude Code (model: Opus 4.5) using React and Vite in a matter of minutes. This was a fun experiment in the usefulness of "vibe coding" for low-stakes projects.
