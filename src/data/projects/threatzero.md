The ThreatZero platform is a web application that provides training and other tooling to schools and corporations to build a safe and resilient culture.

Notable features are the tip submission and threat assessment forms, which are fully managed via the in-app admin panel; the training library, which delivers the right content at the right time to the right user and tracks watch completion stats; and the organization admin panel, which allows global administrators to easily manage organizational units, users, roles, SSO integrations, and training access.
